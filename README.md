# Travelin
CS 307 Project

In these stressful years of college life, you should find time to relax. In a university like Purdue, finding friends to travel with can be a challenging task, as they may not share the same interests as you. While platforms to plan your trips do exist, namely Penroads and Reddit, these are hard to curate, making it difficult for users to trust the people they find on there. We want to make an app for Purdue students which not only fosters trust but also helps them find travel buddies and plan their next vacation.â€¨
